The unrounded values are included for users who may wish to conduct further calculations before rounding (e.g. multi-month or multi-year averaging). Further information on the uncertainty and rounding issues associated with these data can be found in Annex 2 of Kendon et al. (2020): https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.7285"
