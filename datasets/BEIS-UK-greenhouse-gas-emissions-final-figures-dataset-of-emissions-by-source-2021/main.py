metadata.dataset.description = """
This publication provides the final estimates of UK territorial greenhouse gas 
emissions going back to 1990. Figures for all years since 1990 have been 
revised since the last publication to incorporate methodological 
improvements and new data, so the estimates presented here supersede 
previous ones.

Estimates are presented by source in February of each year. They are updated 
in March of each year to include estimates with energy supply emissions on an 
end-user basis, and in June to include estimates by Standard Industrial 
Classification (SIC).

The statistics cover emissions that occur within the UK's borders. When 
emissions are reported by source, emissions are attributed to the sector that 
emits them directly. When emissions are reported by end-user, energy supply 
emissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use 
activity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling 
process. For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is 
allocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis.
