** this dataset is quite tricky so i imagine we will need a couple of goes to get it right but here is my initial spec ** 

Sheet Physical Flows 
    Physical flows will need its own codelist so the data can be maintaied 
    creation of country column to effectively display country data 
    creation of a marker column which will capture the sub-categories of physical flow 

Dimension:
	I think we should have a services dimension and service type dimension i.e. Woodland
	I believe Physical Flow would be classed as a services dimension and therefore column B is the unit and therefore a codelist for these data with a name like measurements this will allow for a unit column.
	

measures:
	Measure Type: Physical flow (codelist DM will create)
	Unit: gbp million 

Table Structure:
	 Country, Physical Flow, Marker, Value


Sheet Annual Value 
Physical flow codelist to be used also for this sheet. Also marker column to capture flows (timber etc.)
country column to be created 
value 

measures:
	Measure Type: Physical flow (codelist DM will create)
	Unit: gbp million 

Table Structure:
	 Country,  Marker, Value


Sheet Asset Value 

Asset value sheet to follow process as previous sheets 

Create  Country, Marker and Value column (totals?)

measures:
	Measure Type: Physical flow (codelist DM will create)
	Unit: gbp million 

Table Structure:
	 Country,  Marker, Value

Methodology
Details of methodologies for woodlands can be found in Woodland natural capital accounts methodology guide, UK: 2020. Further details on the concepts and methodologies underlying the UK natural capital accounts can be found in Principles of Natural Capital Accounting.

Strengths and limitations

Data quality

The ecosystems services are experimental statistics. Currently, there is no single data source for the UK for the individual ecosystem services. They are calculated from data from the four countries with different timeliness.

Ecosystems provide a diverse range of services and not all have been included in this publication, either owing to unavailability of data or the need for new methods of evaluation. We intend to continue to develop our ability to report on all services.
