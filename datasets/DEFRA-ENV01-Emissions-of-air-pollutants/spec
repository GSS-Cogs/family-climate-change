Publication Information:
This publication covers UK emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds, ammonia and particulate matter.

The estimation methodology is regularly developed to take account of new emission factors and modelling methods. This means the whole time series is revised annually. The figures given in this document and the supporting dataset show the revised estimates.
